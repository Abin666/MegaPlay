2016 Solace of Hope

When you go through deep waters, i will be there with you. - Isaiah 43:2


The story of a family and the troubles and trials they went through, at work for the father, the son acting out and the
 abuse faced by the daughter that left them unwelcome to the news of having an addition to the family. In the attempt to cope
 and handle with the situation things just ended up spiraling out of hand.Even when it felt like things would never get better, 
God showed his light and guided them through the darkest night of their lives to help understand the true secret about eternal happiness that it 
is not all about sunshine and flowers but about the rainbow that shines as the dark heavy skies begin to clear. God’s promise to us all.
