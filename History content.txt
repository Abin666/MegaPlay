Beginning of a new Dawn
Do not fear , for i am with you - Isaiah 41:10

This story unfolds  the reign of terror by the Romans and marks 
the beginning of a new dawn . People still have faith  in Lord 
and fathom  hope for a Savior - a Messiah.
The story depicts  the life of Peter who meets  Jesus Christ. 
and leaves all his worldly possessions and priorities behind 
and continues proclaiming the word of Lord. Peter faces many adversaries and witnesses the Holy Spirit guiding his way,
 and dies spreading the love of God.



2016 Solace of Hope

When you go through deep waters, i will be there with you. - Isaiah 43:2


The story of a family and the troubles and trials they went through, at work for the father, the son acting out and the
 abuse faced by the daughter that left them unwelcome to the news of having an addition to the family. In the attempt to cope
 and handle with the situation things just ended up spiraling out of hand.Even when it felt like things would never get better, 
God showed his light and guided them through the darkest night of their lives to help understand the true secret about eternal happiness that it 
is not all about sunshine and flowers but about the rainbow that shines as the dark heavy skies begin to clear. God’s promise to us all.
